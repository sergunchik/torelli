Chapter 1 Graphs and polytopes To a graph \\(G\\) with the set \\(V(G)\\) of trivalent vertices associate a vector space \\(S(G)\\) with a basis \\(e(i)\\) enumerated by (non-oriented) edges of \\(G\\), and a polytope \\(P(G)\\) there given as a convex hull of the vectors \\[\\begin{equation} p(v,s) = s(i) e(i) + s(j) e(j) + s(k) e(k) = ±e(i)±e(j)±e(k), \\end{equation}\\] where the edges \\(i,j,k\\) are outgoing from a single vertex \\(v\\) and \\(s(i),s(j),s(k)\\in\\{\\pm1\\}\\) with \\(s(i)s(j)s(k)=1\\). Let us prove that the polytopes \\(P(G)\\) to \\(P(G&#39;)\\) can be mapped to each other by a pair of (real) affine transformations if and only if the graphs \\(G\\) and \\(G&#39;\\) are isomorphic. 1.1 Graphs of principal series The graph \\(G\\) is said to be of principal series if it satisfies the following: Every connected component of \\(G\\) has at least \\(5\\) trivalent vertices. Graph \\(G\\) has no loops. Graph \\(G\\) has no double edges. Graph \\(G\\) has no leaves. "],["combinatorial-torelli.html", "Chapter 2 Combinatorial Torelli 2.1 Algorithm 2.2 The proof of correctness", " Chapter 2 Combinatorial Torelli Let \\(P = P(G)\\) be a polytope in a real affine space \\(S = S(G)\\) associated with a graph \\(G\\) of principal series. We will reconstruct the graph from the affine relations between the vertices of the polytope (which we further call rays to distinguish them from vertices of the graph). 2.1 Algorithm The center of mass of all rays equals \\(0\\). Principal step. In the set of all semi-sums of all pairs of distinct rays record those that appear at least twice, i.e. record all the centers of the parallelograms that can be obtained as convex hulls of some pairs of diagonals. Claim: these are exactly the vectors \\(±e(i)\\) for all (internal) edges \\(i\\). So at this step we have reconstructed the set of (internal) edges of the graph. Let \\(p(i)\\) be the coordinates of the ray \\(p=p(v,s)\\) in a basis \\(\\{±e(i)\\}\\). The vertices and the adjacency matrix are given by the image of the map \\(p \\mapsto \\{i : p(i) ≠ 0\\}\\). 2.2 The proof of correctness The first two assumptions imply that all vectors \\(p(v,s)\\) are distinct. The second assumption implies that each vector \\(p(v,s)\\) in the basis \\(\\{e(i)\\}\\) is a permutation of \\((±1,±1,±1,0,0,...,0)\\). So all vectors \\(p(v,s)\\) are equidistant from \\(0\\) with respect to the Euclidean norm in which the basis \\(e(i)\\) is orthonormal. This implies that vectors \\(p(v,s)\\) are convex independent, thus their set coincides with the set of the rays (vertices of the polytope \\(P(G)\\)). The latter is partitioned into quadruples \\(\\{p(v,s)\\}\\) enumerated by vertices \\(v \\in V(G)\\). If \\(x,y,z,w\\) are four distinct admissible sign assignments then there is a linear relation \\[\\begin{equation} p(v,x) + p(v,y) + p(v,z) + p(v,w) = 0, \\end{equation}\\] so the center of mass of the rays in any such quadruple is \\(0\\), hence the center of mass of all the rays is \\(0\\). Step 0 is proved. If a vertex \\(v\\in V(G)\\) is incident to edges \\(i,j,k\\) then the \\(6\\) semi-sums of two vectors from a quadruple are equal to \\(±e(i),±e(j),±e(k)\\). So if \\(i\\) is an (internal non-loop) edge connecting vertices \\(v\\) and \\(v&#39;\\) there are at least two distinct ways to write \\(e(i)\\) as a semi-sum of two vectors: \\(2 e(i) = p(v,x) + p(v,y) = p(v&#39;,z&#39;) + p(v&#39;,w&#39;)\\), and similarly \\(-2 e(i) = p(v,z) + p(v,w) = p(v&#39;,x&#39;) + p(v&#39;,y&#39;)\\). To prove the claim of Step 1 it remains to show that no other vector has two representations as a semi-sum. Suppose that for some vertices \\(u,u&#39;,v,v&#39; \\in V(G)\\) and signs \\(x,y,z,w\\) there is a relation \\[\\begin{equation} p(u,x) + p(u&#39;,y) = p(v,z) + p(v&#39;,w) \\end{equation}\\] For each vertex consider the parity of times it appears in a relation. The relation implies that for every edge \\(i\\) the parities of the adjacent vertices are equal. So the assigned parities of vertices are constant in every connected component. Since we have only four terms in a relation, number of odd vertices is at most four, so in every connected component with at least 5 vertices all vertices are even. Thus either \\(u=u&#39;=v=v&#39;\\), but then six semi-sums are all distinct, or there are two vertices and each appears in the relation twice. Hence either each vertex appears only on one side of the equation or both vertices appear on both sides. If each vertex appears on its own side then we have an equation \\(±e(i) = ±e(j)\\) where \\(i\\) is an edge adjacent to \\(u\\) and \\(j\\) is an edge adjacent to \\(v\\), thus \\(i=j\\) and vertices \\(u,v\\) are adjacent to each other. Finally, the equation \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{ssd} p(v,x) + p(v&#39;,w) = p(v,y) + p(v&#39;,z) \\end{equation}\\] is equivalent to \\(p(v,x) - p(v,y) = p(v&#39;,z) - p(v&#39;,w)\\) (where the differences are zero iff the summands on both sides are identical). For every vertex \\(v\\) with edges \\(i,j,k\\) the \\(12\\) semi-differences are equal to \\(±e(i)±e(j),±e(i)±e(k),±e(j)±e(k)\\). So if for two distinct vertices \\(v,v&#39; \\in V(G)\\) and some sign choices \\(x,y,z,w\\) the relation holds, then vertices \\(v\\) and \\(v&#39;\\) would be connected by at least two edges, contradicting to the third assumption. Now Step 1 is justified and Step 2 is straightforward.

In particular if \\(f\\) is the identity and we regard the colorings \\(c,c&#39;\\) as \\(0\\)-chains, then the respective morphisms is the set of \\(1\\)-chains whose boundary is the ratio of \\(c&#39;\\) and \\(c\\), so the set of automorphisms is principal homogeneous over the first relative homology group \\(H_1(G,∂G;\\{\\pm1\\})\\). The composition of \\((f,g) : (G,c) \\to (G&#39;,c&#39;)\\) and \\((f&#39;,g&#39;) : (G&#39;,c&#39;) \\to (G&#39;&#39;,c&#39;&#39;)\\) is \\((f&#39;\\circ f, g&#39;&#39;)\\) where \\(g&#39;&#39;(i&#39;&#39;) := g&#39;(i&#39;&#39;) \\cdot \\prod_{f&#39;(i&#39;) = i&#39;&#39;} g&#39;(i&#39;)\\). Generators for the groupoid of colored graphs can be chosen as morphisms \\((f,g) : (G,c) \\to (G&#39;,c&#39;)\\) with either \\(c = c&#39; \\circ f, g = 1\\) or \\(f\\) being identity and \\(g\\) a coloring of a single edge. 3.2 Functor of quantum Clebsch-Gordan polytopes Define \\(P(G,c)\\) as the convex hull in \\(S(G)\\) of rays \\(p(v,s)\\) with \\(s(i) s(j) s(k) = c(v)\\). Note that \\(P(G) = P(G,c_0)\\), where \\(c_0\\) is the constant coloring \\(c_0(v) = +1 \\forall v\\). Any isomorphism \\((f,g): (G,c) \\to (G&#39;,c&#39;)\\) of colored graphs naturally induces an isomorphism \\(P(f,g) : P(g,c) \\to P(G&#39;,c&#39;)\\) of the associated convex polytopes. For example, the generators of the first kind correspond to “permutations” and the generators of the second kind correspond to linear transformations that send \\(e(i)\\) to \\(-e(i)\\) for the chosen edge \\(i\\) and preserve all other basic vectors. 3.3 Colored combinatorial non-abelian Torelli theorem Theorem 3.1 Association \\(P\\) is a full functor from the groupoid of colored graphs of principal series to the groupoid of convex polytopes and affine isomorphisms. That is, any affinely linear isomorphism between polytopes \\(P(G,c)\\) and \\(P(G&#39;,c&#39;)\\) is induced by a uniquely defined isomorphism of colored graphs. Proof. The steps of the algorithm above can be applied without modifications. Then for any of \\(2^{\\dim S}\\) bases of \\(S\\) with given coordinate axes \\(±e(i)\\) the coloring of the vertices of the graph is well- and uniquely defined by the parity of the number of minus signs in the coordinates of the respective rays in the given basis. A unique choice of signs corresponds to the original coloring, all other choices produce homologically equivalent colorings, unique invariants of colorings are total parity of vertices in every leafless connected component. It suffices to notice that the change of the sign of a single vector in the base corresponds to simultaneous change of the color of the two vertices adjacent to this edge. "],["algebro-geometric-interpretation.html", "Chapter 4 Algebro-geometric interpretation", " Chapter 4 Algebro-geometric interpretation In algebraic geometry the classical (abelian) Torelli is a theorem and an algorithm that reconstructs a closed Riemann surface (smooth projective algebraic curve) \\(C\\) from its Jacobian \\(J(C)\\) equipped with a principal polarization by \\(\\Theta\\)-divisor. Usually “Torelli package” also has a description of the automorphism group of \\((J(C),\\Theta)\\) in terms of automorphisms of \\(C\\), or more generally classifies all isomorphisms between \\((J(C),\\Theta)\\) and \\((J(C&#39;),\\Theta&#39;)\\). The Jacobian \\(J(C)\\) has an interpretation as (a connected component of) the Picard variety, that parametrizes isomorphism classes of line bundles of fixed numerical degree. Similarly the moduli space \\(U_r(C)\\) parametrizes (\\(S\\)-equivalence classes of semi-)stable vector bundles of rank \\(r\\). Let \\(SU_r(C,L)\\) be the fiber of the determinantal fibration \\(\\det: U_r(C) \\to U_1(C)\\) over a line bundle \\(L\\in U_1(C)\\). Any isomorphism of curves \\(f : C \\to C&#39;\\) induces an isomorphism \\(SU_r(C,L) \\to SU_r(C&#39;,f_* L)\\), and any line bundle \\(M \\in U_1(C)\\) induces an isomorphism \\(SU_r(C,L) \\to SU_r(C,L\\otimes M^{\\otimes r})\\) given by \\(E \\mapsto E \\otimes M\\). These isomorphisms generate a groupoid with objects being the pairs \\((C,L)\\) of an algebraic curve \\(C\\) equipped with a line bundle \\(L\\) and morphisms from \\((C,L)\\) to \\((C&#39;,L&#39;)\\) given by triples \\((f,M&#39;;\\iota)\\) of an isomorphism of curves \\(f: C \\to C&#39;\\), a line bundle \\(M&#39;/C&#39;\\) an an isomorphism of line bundles \\(\\iota: f_* L \\to L&#39; \\otimes M&#39;^{\\otimes r}\\), so the association \\((C,L) \\mapsto SU_r(C,L)\\) is promoted to a functor from this groupoid to the groupoid of algebraic varieties and isomorphisms. Unlike Jacobians the spaces \\(SU_r(C,L)\\) have (anti-)canonical polarizations, and a non-abelian Torelli theorem for smooth curves was formulated by Andrey Tyurin following the foundational theorems of Narasimhan-Ramanan and Newstead. Kouvidakis and Pantev (1995) use Higgs bundles to reconstruct the curve \\(C\\) from the respective moduli space \\(SU_r(C,L)\\) and also describe the group of automorphisms of these moduli spaces as an extension of the automorphisms of the curve by \\(r\\)-torsion subgroup in Jacobian, effectively proving that under mild assumptions \\(SU_r\\) considered as a functor between groupoids is full for any \\(r&gt;1\\). In the combinatorial versions of these theorems trivalent graphs are avatars of Riemann surfaces, colorings are avatars of line bundles, polytopes are avatars of moduli spaces, and the functor \\(P\\) is an avatar of the functor \\(SU_2\\). The analogy between curves and trivalent graphs is standard and can be explained by the following underlying geometry. With a graph one can associate a graph curve, the union of projective lines enumerated by vertices of the graph with some common points (nodes) corresponding to the edges. Leaves (if there are any) correspond to additional marked smooth points. These curves form a finite set of the deepest corners of the Deligne-Mumford moduli space of stable marked curves. A path between the corner and the interior of the Deligne-Mumford space corresponds to a degeneration of a smooth algebraic curve to the graph curve, and the respective vanishing cycles give the Thurston cut system of the Riemann surface into trinions (i.e. spheres with three holes or pairs-of-pants) encoded by the same graph. Moduli spaces such as Jacobians and \\(SU_r(C,L)\\) vary together with the smooth curve \\(C\\), and it is natural to look for their limits as \\(C\\) tends to a graph curve \\(C(G)\\).
